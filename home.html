    <p>I went to <div class"bl">SMU</div> for 3 years.</p>    
    <p>I switched my majors <div class="pi">4</div> times.</p>    
    <p>I decided on <div class="bl">computer science</div> and <div class="bl">EMIS</div>.</p>

    <p class="restart">I took <div class="bl">a year off</div> of school.</p>    
    <p>I worked as a software engineer for <div class="pi">L3 Communications</div>.</p>    
    <p>My team built <div class="bl">graphical user interfaces</div> for airplanes.</p>    
    <p class="secret">Shhhhh I can't say anything else..</p>

    <p>I'm addicted to learning about <div class="pi">human-centered design.</div></p>    
    <p class="sub-point">I was introduced to the topic during my favorite SMU course, Building Creative Confidence..</p>    
    <p>I have 1,000 interests and passions, but <div class="bl">people</div> are always at the center.</p>
    <p class="restart">I want to help make <div class="pi">the world a better place</div>.</p>
    <p class="sub-point">hopefully using technology.</p>

    <h1>Morgan Monzingo</h1>
    <p class="restart">I am from Pflugerville,Texas.</p>    
    <p>I went to <a href="http://www.smu.edu">SMU</a> for 3 years.</p>    
    <p>I switched my majors 4 times.</p>    
    <p>I decided on computer science and industrial engineering.</p>    
    <p>I took a bunch of courses, mostly related to computer science.</p>
    <p>I was on track to graduate...</p>
    <p class="restart">I took a year off of school.</p>    
    <p>I worked as a software engineer for L3 Communications.</p>    
    <p>My team built graphical user interfaces for airplanes.</p>    
    <p class="secret">Shhhhh I can't say anything else..</p>
    <p class="restart">I decided to transfer to Texas A&M</p>    
    <p>I'm addicted to learning about <a href="https://www.designkit.org/human-centered-design">human-centered design.</a></p>    
    <p class="sub-point">I was introduced to the topic during my favorite SMU course, Building Creative Confidence..</p>    
    <p>I have 1,000 interests and passions, but people are always at the center.</p>
    <p class="restart">I want to help make the world a better place.</p>
    <p class="sub-point">hopefully using technology.</p>
    <p>I think the "human" needs to be a bigger part in the process.</p>

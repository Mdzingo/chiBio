    <h1>Morgan Monzingo</h1>
    <p class="restart">I am from <span class="p">Pflugerville</span>, Texas.</p>    
    <p>I went to <span class"b">SMU</span> for 3 years.</p>    
    <p>I switched my majors <span class="p">4</span> times.</p>    
    <p>I decided on <span class="b">computer science</span> and <span class="b">EMIS</span>.</p>    
    <p>I took <span class="p">100+ hours</span>, some of it related to computer science.</p>
    <p>I was on track to graduate...</p>
    <p class="restart">I took <span class="b">a year off</span> of school.</p>    
    <p>I worked as a software engineer for <span class="p">L3 Communications</span>.</p>    
    <p>My team built <span class="b">graphical user interfaces</span> for airplanes.</p>    
    <p class="secret">Shhhhh I can't say anything else..</p>
    <p class="restart">I decided to transfer to <span class="b">Texas A&M</span></p>    
    <p>I'm addicted to learning about <span class="p">human-centered design.</span></p>    
    <p class="sub-point">I was introduced to the topic during my favorite SMU course, Building Creative Confidence..</p>    
    <p>I have 1,000 interests and passions, but <span class="b">people</span> are always at the center.</p>
    <p class="restart">I want to help make <span class="p">the world a better place</span>.</p>
    <p class="sub-point">hopefully using technology.</p>
    <p>I think the <span class="b">"human"</span> needs to be at the <span class="b">center</span> of this process..</p>

    <h1>Morgan Monzingo</h1>
    <p class="restart">I am from <a class="p">Pflugerville</a>, Texas.</p>    
    <p>I went to <a class"b">SMU</a> for 3 years.</p>    
    <p>I switched my majors <a class="p">4</a> times.</p>    
    <p>I decided on <a class="b">computer science</a> and <a class="b">EMIS</a>.</p>    
    <p>I took <a class="p">100+ hours</p>, some of it related to computer science.</p>
    <p>I was on track to graduate...</p>
    <p class="restart">I took <a class="b">a year off</a> of school.</p>    
    <p>I worked as a software engineer for <a class="p">L3 Communications</a>.</p>    
    <p>My team built <a class="b">graphical user interfaces</a> for airplanes.</p>    
    <p class="secret">Shhhhh I can't say anything else..</p>
    <p class="restart">I decided to transfer to <a class="b">Texas A&M</a></p>    
    <p>I'm addicted to learning about <a class="p">human-centered design.</a></p>    
    <p class="sub-point">I was introduced to the topic during my favorite SMU course, Building Creative Confidence..</p>    
    <p>I have 1,000 interests and passions, but <a class="b">people</a> are always at the center.</p>
    <p class="restart">I want to help make <a class="p">the world a better place</a>.</p>
    <p class="sub-point">hopefully using technology.</p>
    <p>I think the <a class="b">"human"</a> needs to be at the <a class="b">center</a> of this process..</p>

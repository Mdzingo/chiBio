    <h1>Morgan Monzingo</h1>
    <h3>4th year Senior-ish</h3>
    <div class="me-img"></div>
    <p class="restart">I am from <em class="pi">Pflugerville</em>, Texas.</p>
    <p>I have a <em class="pi">cat</em> named <em class="pi">Annie</em>.    
    <p>I went to <em class="bl">SMU</em> for 3 years.</p>    
    <p>I changed my major <em class="pi">4</em> times.</p>    
    <p>I decided on <em class="bl">Computer Science</em> and <em class="bl">EMIS</em>.</p>
    <p>The courses were project based, focused on <em class="pi">Java, C++</em> and <em class="pi">web development</em>.</p>    
    <p>I took <em class="bl">100+ hours</em>.</p>
        <p class="sub-point">I was on track to graduate...</p>
    <p class="restart">I took <em class="pi">a year off</em> of school.</p>    
    <p>I worked as a software engineer for <em class="bl">L3 Communications</em>.</p>    
    <p>My team built <em class="pi">graphical user interfaces</em> for airplanes.</p>
    <p class="sub-point">Shhhhh I can't say anything else...</p>
    <p class="restart">I decided to transfer to <em class="bl">Texas A&M.</em></p>
    <p>I <em class="pi">moved to College Station</em> on the 15th of January.</p>
    <p>I am still studying <em class="bl">Computer Science.</em></p>
    <p>Furuta gave me one free class to be forced into; I chose <em class ="pi">Computer-Human Interaction</em>.</p>    
    <p class="restart">I'm addicted to learning about <em class="bl">human-centered design.</em></p>
    <p class="sub-point">I was introduced to the topic during my favorite SMU course, Building Creative Confidence.</p>
    <p>I have 1,000 interests and passions, but <em class="pi">people</em> are always at the center.</p>
    <p class="restart">When I grow up, I want to help <em class="bl"> make the world a better place</em>.</p>
    <p class="sub-point">hopefully using technology.</p>
    <p>I think the <em class="pi">"human"</em> needs to be at the <em class="pi">center</em> of anything I build or create.</p>
    <p class="restart bl">I will be spending as much of the future as I can focused on this goal.</p>
